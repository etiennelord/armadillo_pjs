help=Transition/transversion ratio \: This option can be used before a global or treefile option with auxiliary data.\\n\\nRandomize input order of sequences (jumble)\:Note that fastDNAml explores a very small number of alternative tree topologies relative to a typical parsimony program. There is a very real chance that the search procedure will not find the tree topology with the highest likelihood. Altering the order of taxon addition and comparing the trees found is a fairly efficient method for testing convergence. Typically, it would be nice to find the same best tree at least twice (if not three times), as opposed to simply performing some fixed number of jumbles and hoping that at least one of them will be the optimum.\n\nGlobal rearrangements \: The G (global) option has been generalized to permit crossing any number of branches during tree rearrangements. In addition, it is possible to modify the extent of rearrangement explored during the sequential addition phase of tree building.\nThe G U (global and user tree) option combination instructs the program to find the best of the user trees, and then look for rearrangements that are better still. If a rearrangement distance is specified, the input must contain a transition option.\nThe Global option can be used to force branch swapping on user trees, (combination of Global and User Tree(s) options).\n\nUser input Tree Options\: This options allows you to enter your own trees and instructs the program to evaluate them.\n\nUser tree - tree(s) file (Tree)\: The trees must be in Newick format, and terminated with a semicolon. (The program also accepts a pseudo_newick format, which is a valid prolog fact.)\nThe tree reader in this program is more powerful than that in PHYLIP 3.3. In particular, material enclosed in square brackets, [ like this ], is ignored as comments; taxa names can be wrapped in single quotation marks to support the inclusion of characters that would otherwise end the name (i.e., '(', ')', '\:', ';', '[', ']', ',' and ' '); names of internal nodes are properly ignored; and exponential notation (such as 1.0E-6) for branch lengths is supported.\n\nUser trees to be read with branch lengths \: Causes user trees to be read with branch lengths (and it is an error to omit any of them). Without the L option, branch lengths in user trees are not required, and are ignored if present.\n\nGenerates a re-sample of the input data (bootstrap)\: Tree files will be summarized in one '.tree' file as well as output files in one '.out' file\n\nRandom number seed for first bootstrap\: Warning\: For a given random number seed, the sample will always be the same.
