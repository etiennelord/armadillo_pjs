Description=The computational inference of ancestral genomes consists of five difficult steps\: identifying syntenic regions, inferring ancestral arrangement of syntenic regions, aligning multiple sequences, reconstructing the insertion and deletion history and finally inferring substitutions. Each of these steps have received lot of attention in the past years. However, there currently exists no framework that integrates all of the different steps in an easy workflow. Here, we introduce Ancestors 1.0, a web server allowing one to easily and quickly perform the last three steps of the ancestral genome reconstruction procedure. It implements several alignment algorithms, an indel maximum likelihood solver and a context-dependent maximum likelihood substitution inference algorithm. The results presented by the server include the posterior probabilities for the last two steps of the ancestral genome reconstruction and the expected error rate of each ancestral base prediction. AVAILABILITY\: The Ancestors 1.0 is available at http\://ancestors.bioinfo.uqam.ca/ancestorWeb/.\n(C) Abdoulaye Banire Diallo.

help=INPUT \:\nAncestor need a rooted binary phylogenetic tree.\nThe tree must include the branch length with no bootstrap \nvalues. The name of species must be identical to those \nin the multiple sequence alignment input. \nAn example of a correct tree is given in sample in the interface.\n\nINSERTION AND DELETION SCENARIO COMPUTATION PARAMETERS\:\nThe indel parameters option permits to indicate the algorithm to be run. \nSix algorithms have been implemented. \nThose algorithms are divided in two parts\:\n1 \=> The best scenarios\: permits to find the best indel scenario \nusing the viterbi algorithms. It gives the best 1-0 character \nassignments in the ancestor sequences.\n2 \=> The posterior decoding\: permit to compute the probability \nof having either 1 or 0 in each position of the ancestral \nsequences using the forward-backward algorithm.\n\n\nFor each part, it is possible to run either the exact \nalgorithm or the heuristic one\:\nExact algorithm \: it finds the solution by assessing \nall the possible paths. Due to the large number of \npaths, the speed can drastically be affected.\nHeuristic algorithm\: it permits the reduction of the \nnumber of paths using two approches. The first one \nreduces the number of analyzed paths by eliminating \nall the paths in a given alignment column that is out \nof the range given by the maximal value and maximal \nvalue added of an absolute likelihood value. The second \none keeps only a percentage of the best solutions. \nIt is worth noting that higher those values are, \nthey tend to correspond to exact solution.
